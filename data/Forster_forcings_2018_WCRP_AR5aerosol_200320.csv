"  March 2017 GHG RF timeseries updated following Etminan, M., G. Myhre, E. J. Highwood, and K. P. Shine (2016), Radiative forcing of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide: A significant revision of the methane radiative forcing, Geophys. Res. Lett., 43, 12,614-12,623, doi:10.1002/2016GL071930. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Volcanic data is the most important but also must tricky. A new paper doubles IPCC Estimates. I've included this larger cooling from 2008: the start of the new timeseries. This might lead to a cooling ?jump from 2007 to 2008 ?- you should check how this affects results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
